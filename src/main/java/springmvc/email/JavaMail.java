Dairy and egg products, meat and potato salad are examples for food that spoils fast. Enterotoxinogenic bacteria are most commonly staphylococcus aureus, and sometimes bacillus cereus or clostridium perfringens. The toxin of staphylococcus aureus, which frequently causes foodborne diseases, is heat resistant.

The symptoms usually occur within few hours after consuming the affected food. With the exception of the very rare botulism, patients fully recover without any long-term consequences.\"</h5><br>\n" +

Nonetheless, an infection, e.g. salmonella or norovirus should be taken into consideration as well. In cases of doubt, the enterotoxins can often be established in the spoilt food. The symptoms typically last for 1 to 2 days. Therapy is purely for the symptoms. Most important is the replacement of liquids and salts, and in some cases antispasmodic medication. Especially older patients or children may require in-patient treatment with infusions, to regulate the liquid- and salt balance. Generally it is important to make sure that foods bought or consumed are fresh and not spoilt. It is also important to know that even heating up foods can't remove certain bacterial toxins.\"</h5>\n" ;
